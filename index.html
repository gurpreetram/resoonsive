They keep on asking questions to quench their curiosity. It is human nature that we have an immense desire to know about everything that is happening around us. The knowledge about everything can be attained by studies. The books of different subjects help us in understanding knowing about different things present around us. Just think that if we have not studied the names of different vegetables and fruits how we would be able to distinguish the same. The study is therefore a very important process in our life.</p>
